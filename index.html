      <h1>Introducing Myself</h1>

      <main>
        <p class="paragraph"> Hey everyone! My names Jordan, and I'm a young 25 year old, living in rural South Australia (born and bred).</p>

          <p class="p1">I am currently studying IT and Programming at RMIT University, but my background in education and qualifications comes quite varied.</p>

          <p class="p1">Before now, I completed my year 12, further going on to complete my certificate I and II in Automotive, before having enough experience in this field to see it wasn't the right career pathway for me. I left my education behind temporarily, heading off into the workforce, as a factory hand, where I later decided I wanted more out of life and, having been training in Mixed Martial Arts for the previous number of years, decided that I would return to education and become qualified as a security guard.</p>
      
          <p class="p1">  By now, I have moved into a government position in agricultural bio-security and wish to venture off into a career in algorithmic trading, as it is something I have already delved into, and rather enjoy doing.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Interest in IT">
        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

          <p class="paragraph">My interest in IT first began when I discovered online marketing and cryptocurrencies. It lead me down a path of discovering web page developments, online marketing, and further into my real passion; trading in the financial markets. My online website I did not have as much fun with and soon failed because I was far better at, and more interested in, trading in the markets. This journey I went down helped me discover my love for learning, and true appreciation for mathematics in a computing format.</p>
            <p class="p1">After 5 years of trading in the cryptocurrency markets, and by this time having some decent amounts of success with it, learning how to read the markets better and better, I ventured off again to see how else I could make money online. Admittedly, I ended up creating automations for mobile games with the use of emulators, and advanced macro recorders. This lead me into programming, and so did the extremely large excel files I was using to create deep analysis of the game mechanics. After doing this for several months and enjoying the programming/computing side to it more then I did actually playing the game, I decided why not make a career out of it? </p>
            <p class="p1">During my studies, in both IT and programming, I hope to obtain all the skills necessary in order to turn this passion into a life long career. Being able to operate computers to an advanced level, create my own websites, and program software, would help me not only in my future career prospects, but also, hopefully, into advanced trade automation</p>
    </div>
    <div id="My Ideal Career">
        <h1>My Ideal Career</h1>

          <p class="paragraph">Here is a link to my dream career, as a algorithmic trader: <a href="https://blog.quantinsti.com/making-career-algorithmic-trading/">https://blog.quantinsti.com/making-career-algorithmic-trading/</a></p>
      
          <img src="Images/Screenshot.png" class="img1">

          <p class="paragraph">Now, as you may have guessed so far, my dream is to one day become an algorithmic trader for large trading institutions. This job is to write the programs which assist financial trading insitutions in creating trade automations.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">I wish to partake in this job so that I can pursue four hobbies in one; learning, computing mathematics, trading in the financial markets, and last but definitely not least, programming. </p>

          <p class="paragraph"> To become an algorithmic trader, I will first become qualified in quantitative programming and financial analysis. In the mean time, having a degree in IT and currently being a government employee could lead on to a career in IT, working for the South Australian government. This, I believe would look very good on a resume. Other skills necessary, or desired include knowledge of the financial markets, finance, and mathematics.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">Currently, towards this area, I am skilled and knowlegable in the trading of cryptocurrencies, although not stocks or shares, and believe I have a very good work history for references into future jobs.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">My first step to obtain these skills is through studying IT and Programming at RMIT University, to which I will later go on to look into courses more tailored towards financial programming and quantitative analysis. This would also qualify me for other jobs in the industry should my interest divert in the years to come.</p>

    <div id="Personality Profile">
        <h1>Personality Profile</h1>

          <p class="paragraph"> <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/270e6bc3c0307">My "16 personalities" Test</a></p>
          <p class="paragraph"> <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=6&T=8">My Learning Styles Quiz</a> </p>
          <p class="paragraph"> <a href="https://sdtest.ru/en/result/7126fcf986dd61f761b394cdbf42bdf3">My Spiral Dynamics Test(Pyschological Analysis)</a></p>

          <p class="paragraph">The first test, the '16 personalities' test, returned results depicting me as quite the open minded and passionate debater, although with a tendency to unintentionally "step on peoples toes" in the process. Meanwhile, the 'My Learning Styles Quiz' indicated that I am a fairly broad learner, in that I came back with 30/30/40 results for auditory, visual, and tactile learning, with a slight lean towards the tactile area. And lastly, I chose to do a 'Spiral Dynamics' test. This is one I know of previously and is quite a broad subject, in which you could research for hours on end. It focuses on a theory of psychological evolution, analysing the link between human evolution, different time eras/locations, and pyschological mindests related. It is interesting because with how fast technology and standards of living have changed over the past 200 years, human mindsets appear to be varied now more then ever, creating large differences of mindsets between today's individuals. My results in this test, in short, indicate that I am open minded and innovative, always desiring to see topics from both points of view. This relates a reasonable amount to the results of my first test, '16personalities'</p>
          <p class="paragraph">These results, in my opinion, indicate to me that whilst I can have tendencies to be domineering, albeit unintentionally, I am a dedicated learner, always having a strong desire for self development and ingenuity. These results are remarkably accurate to my current knowledge of myself (I know this because of my strong desire to learn and study personal development, also leading into human psychology). Because of my broad range of knowledge across many interests, I can sometimes have a tendency to take over in team work situations, or naturally desire to be the leader. That being said, being also open minded and into personal development, I have the ability to quite happily restrain myself if I see a better potential leader to elect. Despite the mentioned love of debates, I do this purely for knowledge reasons, and one thing that goes unmentioned as far as I have read into these results, is that I am actually conflict avoidant, an unusual combination, which requires balance. I far prefer to be tactful and polite in the way I come across then to be rude or offend people.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">When going further into Uni studies throughout the rest of my course, I will make sure to let others speak first, paying close attention to what they say and making sure they feel heard and respected. I know that whilst naturally I will want to contribute as much as possible, which can be a good thing, and debate eagerly on issues that may arise, this is still teamwork, and all members need to be felt respected and desired. Debating does not always come across how I intend it to.</p>

    <div id="My Project Idea">
        <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">My project Idea is to create an app that not only helps people with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) to find out what foods they can and can’t eat, but also helps them monitor their diet and symptoms, provides feedback based on those criteria, and more significantly, hosts a meal planning nutrition calculator specific to people with GERD who are trying not just to find the foods they can and can’t eat, but to also set up a diet in which they can pursue their health and fitness goals. </p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The motivation behind me choosing such a specific application is due to me being one of those people affected by GERD. It’s a health issue that has had a dramatic impact on my life, and has forced me to give up perhaps 50% of the foods I used to eat, from dairies, fatty acids, and some meats, vegetables, and even certain fruits, plus a reasonable amount more than just that. GERD is also a condition that can affect your weight, and as such, I go to the gym and manage my diet accordingly to live my life as healthy as possible. I have found that looking for GERD specific gym meal plans tends to be quite difficult, and have not found any apps to date that involve all of the functions I’d plan to incorporate into this application.</p>
          <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Given the complexity of this app, I would like to break it down into three categories; Information about GERD, a ‘Diet and Symptoms Tracker’, and a GERD based nutritional meal planner.</p>
            <h3>Infromation about GERD</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">This section of the app will help to educate the user on GERD, providing them with lists of good and bad foods, along with a search bar, for them to easily type in an item when they’re out shopping. I also plan to include information regarding the importance of various nutrients, so that the user will be able to see exactly what types of foods they need to be including in their diet in order to get a healthy overall diet, that supports all of their nutritional requirements.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">GERD is not only about food. In this section, I will also include other tips and advice for people suffering with this condition, such as how much water to drink, and reminding people to either stand when eating, or go for a walk after each meal to reduce the pressure placed on their stomach.</p>
            <h3>Diet and Symptoms Tracker</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">This section of the app would feature a diet diary, a symptoms tracker, and pop-up advice in relation to such symptoms.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The diet diary is fairly self-explanatory; a day-by-day diary for users to input what they have consumed each day (both foods and liquids). An important part to this diary would also be the optional ability to add a diagnosis date. This date would assist the symptoms tracker to determine how far they are into their journey, and take the information into account when deciding on advice to give the user.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The symptoms tracker would be made up of a daily checklist, including GERD related symptoms, a toiletry usage tracker, and if they have vomited during the day, plus if so, how many times? All of this information would work inter-connectively with the diet diary, and find any possible links between the food/liquids they are consuming, and the symptoms they are receiving. This is because GERD can act differently for each person, and some users will be able to consume things that others can’t.</p>
            <h3>GERD Based nutritional Planner</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">The ‘GERD Based Nutritional Planner’ is where it all comes together. After seeing the various pieces of advice available for them, and hopefully having started tracking what they’ve been consuming recently, the user will then be ready to be introduced to a wide interface, which gathers other forms of information from them (such as their height, weight, age, and body goals), as well as more fitness based information including but not limited to their exercise amount, the type of exercise they do, how they typically perform in prior fitness journeys (to establish the individuals body functions, such as metabolism, and a history of past struggles), and they amount they would typically eat in a day.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Once that data is collected from the user, it will use it to generate both personalised goal related advice, and graphs on suggested nutrient ratios and quantities. This will not be the final advice, as in the world of health and fitness, plateaus are reached, and requirements may need growth and/or adaptation. Monthly check ups will be necessary/highly recommended. </p>
              <p class="paragraph">Last but not least, one of the most useful features to the Nutritional Planner, will be the actual planner in itself. This will include a search function for individual foods and their nutritional value, tabs for multiple different meals to be created, and a daily meal planner that gathers all of the data selected for the day, and displays both the daily nutritional intake, and whether or not it falls within their personalised requirements.</p>
          <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">To create this application, my preferred choice for the coding would be python, due to my knowledge of the code, it’s ease of use, and calculative data analysis software. I will also need to have both a PC and mobile phone handy for the creation and testing of the application, plus a lot of Google searching for further information. Aside from technology, it would also be helpful to seek advice from doctors, nutritionists, and personal trainers.</p>
          <h2>The Skills Required</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Albeit a large amount of research and coding necessary to create this application, the actual skills required in the application development will mostly come down to the ability to code with Python, prior knowledge of app creation, the ability to create an aesthetically pleasing application, and knowledge of mathematic processes, GERD, nutrition, and health and fitness. Given that I would like the app to be successful, it would also help to have knowledge of marketing and business development.</p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The outcome of this app would be an extremely helpful tool for the use of not only people who are suffering from GERD and aiming towards goals with their health and fitness, but also to people with GERD in general. It would also be helpful to note that GERD is closely related to acid reflux, and therefore this app could be used by people with acid reflux as well. The impact this app could have would largely go un-noticed for non-GERD/Reflux sufferers, however for those who do have and suffer from these issues, this could be crucial for their recovery.</p>
